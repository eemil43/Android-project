Android app for showing news

Eemil Himanen

This application shows news from different sources. It gets the news from newsapi.org
You can click any category and it will show news from that category only. Then you can click on any news and it will show a little bit of that news. Then you can click on the button "Read full news" and it will open up the news in your browser. Simple but effective app for reading news.

You can see the code from the files in here but you can't run the project because I wasn't able to compress the files. I tried but I couldn't get them all here since maximum size seems to be 25mb. If this is not enough then please contact me and I will try to get the whole project somewhere.

This link should get you to the video of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxypElcJu0E
