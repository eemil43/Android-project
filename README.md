Android app for showing news

Eemil Himanen

This application shows news from different sources. It gets the news from newsapi.org
You can click any category and it will show news from that category only. Then you can click on any news and it will show a little bit of that news. Then you can click on the button "Read full news" and it will open up the news in your browser. Simple but effective app for reading news.
